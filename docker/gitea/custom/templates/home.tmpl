                        <p>OpenDev is a space for collaborative Open Source software development.</p>
                        <p>OpenDev’s mission is to provide project hosting, continuous integration tooling,
                        and virtual collaboration spaces for Open Source software projects. OpenDev is
                        itself self hosted on this set of tools including Code Review (Gerrit), Continuous
                        Integration (Zuul), Etherpad, Wiki (mediawiki), Code Browsing (gitea) and so on.
                        This means that OpenDev itself is run like an open source project, you
                        can join us and help run the system. Additionally all of the services we run are
                        open source software themselves.</p>

                        <h1 id="current-status">Current Status</h1>

                        <p>We are still very early in the process of building this out. We have DNS servers
                        and this website running to start.</p>
                        <p>Most of the services we plan to run will be inherited and rebranded from the
                        existing community run OpenStack Infrastructure. This means that we do already
                        have services running, but until we transition them into OpenDev they may say
                        “OpenStack” across the top or in their URLs.</p>

                        <h1 id="changes-we-plan-to-make">Changes we plan to make</h1>
                        <p>There are far too many things to capture here so we’ll go after the highlights instead:</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>Move existing services like Gerrit and Etherpad under the opendev.org domain. Remove OpenStack branding as necessary.</li>
                                <li>For the code review and CI toolchain treat the services as multitenant. This will likely involve moving code repos around.
                                <ul>
                                        <li>We’ll need to build better project renaming and provisioning tools.</li>
                                </ul></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>As mentioned previously the OpenDev services themselves are open source software managed on top of Opendev itself. This means that in addition to using OpenDev to host your software development activities you can help us run OpenDev with all of the same tools.</p>
                        <p>If you use the system and find it useful, we’d love to have your help running it as well.</p>

                        <h2 id="isnt-this-just-openstack-infrastructure-rebranded">Isn’t this just OpenStack Infrastructure rebranded?</h2>
                        <p>It is more than that. We want to make this toolset available to others that would find it helpful. OpenStack would become one of the OpenDev tenants, but other tenants like Zuul or $gizmo would be just as important.</p>

                        <h2 id="can-i-host-my-project-on-opendev">Can I host my project on OpenDev?</h2>
                        <p>Yes! However, as noted above it is still early days yet and the early experience might be a bit bumpy. Certain things may still say “OpenStack” on them as we figure out the transition. And while any moves should come with appropriate redirects, we may have some inadvertent misses.</p>

                        <h2 id="can-i-run-tests-on-windows-or-osx-machines">Can I run tests on Windows or OSX machines?</h2>
                        <p>Currently all of our test resources are Linux based. Adding additional platforms would likely require someone to help us get that running, but Zuul will support systems with ansible connection plugins. Talk to us!</p>

                        <h2 id="i-am-an-existing-openstack-infra-user-do-i-need-to-do-anything">I am an existing OpenStack Infra user do I need to do anything?</h2>
                        <p>No. We’ll continue to communicate changes as they happen. We’ll also do our best to make this as smooth a transition as possible. If we run into situations that force us to break something we’ll be sure to let you know at that point.</p>

                        <h2 id="is-a-cla-required-for-hosted-repos">Is a CLA required for hosted repos?</h2>
                        <p>No.</p>

                        <h2 id="what-if-i-dont-like-gerrit-and-would-prefer-insert-tool-here">What if I don’t like Gerrit and would prefer (insert tool here)?</h2>
                        <p>We’ve got a fair bit of experience with the existing toolset and adding new tools for which we’ve already got an answer is currently out of scope. We think the existing tools (like Gerrit) work well, and should only get better as we update them. The system is able to scale because we do not need multiple implementations of different software that solve similar problems.</p>
