# k8s-on-openstack uses the baked in ubuntu user and ssh keypairs
# to interact with the host. Our other roles assume that we'll be
# logging in directly as root. Run base-repos logging in as ubuntu
# with become: true set so that we can overwrite the root ssh key
# with the one allowing direct login from bridge.
