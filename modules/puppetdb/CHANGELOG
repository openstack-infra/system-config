## puppetlabs-puppetdb changelog

Release notes for the puppetlabs-puppetdb module.

------------------------------------------

#### 3.0.0 - 2013/10/27

This major release changes the main dependency for the postgresql module from
version 2.5.x to 3.x. Since the postgresql module is not backwards compatible,
this release is also not backwards compatible. As a consequence we have taken
some steps to deprecate some of the older functionality:

* The parameter manage_redhat_firewall for the class puppetdb has now been removed completely in favor of open_postgres_port and open_ssl_listen_port.
* The parameter manage_redhat_firewall for the class puppetdb::database::postgresql, has now been renamed to manage_firewall.
* The parameter manage_redhat_firewall for the class puppetdb::server has now been removed completely in favor of open_listen_port and open_ssl_listen_port.
* The internal class: puppetdb::database::postgresql_db has been removed. If you were using this, it is now defunct.
* The class puppetdb::server::firewall has been marked as private, do not use it directly.
* The class puppetdb::server::jetty_ini and puppetdb::server::database_ini have been marked as private, do not use it directly.

All of this is documented in the upgrade portion of the README.

Additionally some features have been included in this release as well:

* soft_write_failure can now be enabled in your puppetdb.conf with this
  module to handle failing silently when your PuppetDB is not available
  during writes.
* There is a new switch to enable SSL connectivity to PostgreSQL. While this
  functionality is only in its infancy this is a good start.

Detailed Changes:

* FM-103: Add metadata.json to all modules. (Ashley Penney)
* Add soft_write_failure to puppetdb.conf (Garrett Honeycutt)
* Add switch to configure database SSL connection (Stefan Dietrich)
* (GH-91) Update to use rspec-system-puppet 2.x (Ken Barber)
* (GH-93) Switch to using puppetlabs-postgresql 3.x (Ken Barber)
* Fix copyright and project notice (Ken Barber)
* Adjust memory for PuppetDB tests to avoid OOM killer (Ken Barber)
* Ensure ntpdate executes early during testing (Ken Barber)

------------------------------------------

#### 2.0.0 - 2013/10/04

This major release changes the main dependency for the inifile module from
the deprecated `cprice404/inifile` to `puppetlabs/inifile` to remove
deprecation warnings and to move onto the latest and greatest implementation
of that code.

Its a major release, because it may affect other dependencies since modules
cannot have overlapping second part dependencies (that is inifile cannot be from
two different locations).

It also adds the parameter `puppetdb_service_status` to the class `puppetdb` to
allow users to specify whether the module manages the puppetdb service for you.

The `database_password` parameter is now optional, and initial Arch Linux
support has been added.

Detailed Changes:

* (GH-73) Switch to puppetlabs/inifile from cprice/inifile (Ken Barber)
* Make database_password an optional parameter (Nick Lewis)
* add archlinux support (Niels Abspoel)
* Added puppetdb service control (Akos Hencz)

------------------------------------------

#### 1.6.0 - 2013/08/07

This minor feature release provides extra parameters for new configuration
items available in PuppetDB 1.4, and also provides some older parameters
that were missed previously:

* gc_interval
* log_slow_statements
* conn_max_age
* conn_keep_alive
* conn_lifetime

Consult the README.md file, or the PuppetDB documentation for more details.

------------------------------------------

#### 1.5.0 - 2013/07/18

This minor feature release provides the following new functionality:

* The module is now capable of managing PuppetDB on SUSE systems
  for which PuppetDB packages are available
* The ruby code for validating the PuppetDB connection now
  supports validating on a non-SSL HTTP port.

------------------------------------------

#### 1.4.0 - 2013/05/13

This feature release provides support for managing the puppetdb report
processor on your master.

To enable the report processor, you can do something like this:

    class { 'puppetdb::master::config':
        manage_report_processor => true,
        enable_reports => true
    }

This will add the 'puppetdb' report processor to the list of `reports`
inside your master's `puppet.conf` file.

------------------------------------------

#### 1.3.0 - 2013/05/13

This feature release provides us with a few new features for the PuppetDB
module.

You can now disable SSL when using the `puppetdb` class by using the new
parameter `disable_ssl`:

    class { 'puppetdb':
      disable_ssl => true,
    }

This will remove the SSL settings from your `jetty.ini` configuration file
disabling any SSL communication. This is useful when you want to offload SSL
to another web server, such as Apache or Nginx.

We have now added an option `java_args` for passing in Java options to
PuppetDB. The format is a hash that is passed in when declaring the use of the
`puppetdb` class:

    class { 'puppetdb':
      java_args => {
        '-Xmx' => '512m',
        '-Xms' => '256m',
      }
    }

Also, the default `report-ttl` was set to `14d` in PuppetDB to align it with an
upcoming PE release, so we've also reflected that default here now.

And finally we've fixed the issue whereby the options `report_ttl`, `node_ttl`,
`node_purge_ttl` and `gc_interval` were not making the correct changes. On top
of that you can now set these values to zero in the module, and the correct
time modifier (`s`, `m`, `h` etc.) will automatically get applied for you.

Behind the scenes we've also added system and unit testing, which was
previously non-existent. This should help us reduce regression going forward.

Thanks to all the contributing developers in the list below that made this
release possible :-).

#### Changes

* Allows for 0 _ttl's without time signifier and enables tests (Garrett Honeycutt)
* Add option to disable SSL in Jetty, including tests and documentation (Christian Berg)
* Cleaned up ghoneycutt's code a tad (Ken Barber)
* the new settings report_ttl, node_ttl and node_purge_ttl were added but they are not working, this fixes it (fsalum)
* Also fix gc_interval (Ken Barber)
* Support for remote puppetdb (Filip Hrbek)
* Added support for Java VM options (Karel Brezina)
* Add initial rspec-system tests and scaffolding (Ken Barber)

------------------------------------------

#### 1.2.1 - 2013/04/08

This is a minor bugfix that solves the PuppetDB startup exception:

    java.lang.AssertionError: Assert failed: (string? s)

This was due to the default `node-ttl` and `node-purge-ttl` settings not having a time suffix by default. These settings required 's', 'm', 'd' etc. to be suffixed, even if they are zero.

#### Changes

* (Ken Barber) Add 's' suffix to period settings to avoid exceptions in PuppetDB

------------------------------------------

#### 1.2.0 - 2013/04/05

This release is primarily about providing full configuration file support in the module for PuppetDB 1.2.0. (The alignment of version is a coincidence I assure you :-).

This feature release adds the following new configuration parameters to the main `puppetdb` class:

* node_ttl
* node_purge_ttl (available in >=1.2.0)
* report_ttl

Consult the README for futher details about these new configurable items.
