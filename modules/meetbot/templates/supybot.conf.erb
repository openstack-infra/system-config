supybot.replies.noUser: I can't find %s in my user database. If you didn't\

###

###
supybot.replies.genericNoCapability: You're missing some capability you\
                                     need. This could be because you\
                                     actually possess the anti-capability\
                                     for the capability that's required of\
                                     you, or because the channel provides\
                                     that anti-capability by default, or\
                                     because the global capabilities include\
                                     that anti-capability. Or, it could be\
                                     because the channel or\
                                     supybot.capabilities.default is set to\
                                     False, meaning that no commands are\
                                     allowed unless explicitly in your\
                                     capabilities. Either way, you can't do\
