<h1>Guide to Tempest Results Runs</h1>
<p>
  You are looking at the full test results of a devstack setup and
  tempest run for the OpenStack gate, as well as all the logs of all the
  relevant services that were running during that tempest test run. From
  them you should have enough information to debug.
</p>
<h2>How To Debug - Quickstart</h2>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>scroll to the end of console.html
    <li>work your way backwards until the first failing test
    <li>copy the timestamp of that failing test
    <li>go into logs directory and look at that time stamp in related
    service logs for traces, failures, or other oddities
  </ol>
</p>
<h2>File Overview</h2>
<h3>console.html</h3>
This file contains the stdout/stderr console of the devstack-gate
job. The basic flow of the file goes as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Boot guest from base Linux image
  <li>Use devstack to install all required packages (debs and pips)
  <li>Use devstack to setup all the services from upstream master except
    for the particular project being tested, which is pulled from
    gerrit.
  <li>Run devstack exercises (very basic sanity checking)
  <li>Run tempest tests
</ul>
<p>
  All the devstack setup is done under bash tracing, so
  is <b>extremely</b> verbose. This is to ensure enough data is captured
  so that you can debug failures in the gate with the information provided.
</p>
<p>
  The tempest tests are the last 1% of the console.html. When looking
  at failures it is typical best to start at the end of the file and
  work backwards.
</p>
<h3>logs</h3>
<p>
  The <a href="logs">logs</a> directory contains all the screen logs
  from all the services during the devstack-gate run.
